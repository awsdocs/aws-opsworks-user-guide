# Step 8 \(Optional\): Clean Up<a name="gettingstarted-linux-clean-up"></a>

To prevent incurring additional charges to your AWS account, you can delete the AWS resources that were used for this walkthrough\. These AWS resources include the AWS OpsWorks Stacks stack and the stack's components\. \(For more information, see [AWS OpsWorks Pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/opsworks/pricing/)\.\) However, you might want to keep using these AWS resources as you continue to learn more about AWS OpsWorks Stacks\. If you want to keep these AWS resources available, you have now completed this walkthrough, and you can skip to [Next Steps](gettingstarted-linux-next-steps.md)\.

Content stored in the resources that you created for this walkthrough can contain personally\-identifying information\. If you no longer want this information to be stored by AWS, follow steps in this topic\.

1. For **MyLinuxDemoApp**, for **Actions**, choose **delete**\. When the confirmation message is displayed, choose **Delete**\. AWS OpsWorks Stacks deletes the app\.

**To delete the instance for the stack**

1. In the service navigation pane, choose **Instances**\. The **Instances** page is displayed\.

1. For **MyLinuxDemoLayer**, for **demo1**, for **Actions**, choose **stop**\. When you see the confirmation message, choose **Stop**\. The following happens\.
