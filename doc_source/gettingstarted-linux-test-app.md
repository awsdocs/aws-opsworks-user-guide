1. If you have a Twitter account, choose **Tweet** or **Follow @AWSOpsWorks**, and follow the on\-screen directions to tweet about the app or to follow @AWSOpsWorks\.

You have now successfully tested the deployed app on the instance\.

In the [next step](gettingstarted-linux-clean-up.md), you can clean up the AWS resources that you used for this walkthrough\. This next step is optional\. You may want to keep using these AWS resources as you continue to learn more about AWS OpsWorks Stacks\. However, keeping these AWS resources around may result in some ongoing charges to your AWS account\. If you want to keep these AWS resources around for later use, you have now completed this walkthrough, and you can skip ahead to [Next Steps](gettingstarted-linux-next-steps.md)\.
