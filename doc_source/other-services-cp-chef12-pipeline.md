# Step 5: Create a pipeline in CodePipeline<a name="other-services-cp-chef12-pipeline"></a>

After you have a stack with a layer and at least one instance configured in AWS OpsWorks Stacks, create a pipeline in CodePipeline with AWS OpsWorks Stacks as the provider to deploy apps or Chef cookbooks to your AWS OpsWorks Stacks resources\.

**To create a pipeline**

1. Open the CodePipeline console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/codepipeline/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/)\.

1. Choose **Create pipeline**\.

1. On the **Getting started with CodePipeline** page, type **MyOpsWorksPipeline**, or any other pipeline name that is unique to your account, and then choose **Next step**\.

1. On the **Source Location** page, select **Amazon S3** from the **Source provider** drop\-down list\.

1. In the **Amazon S3 details** area, type your Amazon S3 bucket path, in the format **s3://*bucket\-name*/*file name***\. Refer to the link that you noted in step 9 of [Step 3: Upload app code to an Amazon S3 bucket](other-services-cp-chef12-s3.md)\. In this walkthrough, the path is `s3://my-appbucket/opsworks-nodejs-demo-app.zip`\. Choose **Next step**\.

1. On the **Build** page, choose **No Build** from the drop\-down list, and then choose **Next step**\.

1. On the **Deploy** page, choose **AWS OpsWorks Stacks** as the deployment provider\.

1. In the **Stack** field, type `CodePipelineDemo`, or the name of the stack that you created in [Step 1: Create a stack, layer, and an instance in AWS OpsWorks Stacks](other-services-cp-chef12-stack.md)\.

1. In the **Layer** field, type `Node.js App Server`, or the name of the layer that you created in [Step 1: Create a stack, layer, and an instance in AWS OpsWorks Stacks](other-services-cp-chef12-stack.md)\.

1. In the **App** field, select the app that you uploaded to Amazon S3 in [Step 3: Upload app code to an Amazon S3 bucket](other-services-cp-chef12-s3.md), and then choose **Next step**\.

1. On the **AWS Service Role** page, choose **Create Role**\.

   A new window opens with an IAM console page that describes the role that will be created for you, `AWS-CodePipeline-Service`\. From the **Policy name** drop\-down list, choose **Create new policy**\. Be sure the policy document has the following content\. Choose **Edit** to change the policy document, if required\.

   ```
   {
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Action": [
                   "s3:GetObject",
                   "s3:GetObjectVersion",
                   "s3:GetBucketVersioning"
               ],
               "Resource": "*",
               "Effect": "Allow"
           },
           {
               "Action": "opsworks:*",
               "Resource": "*",
               "Effect": "Allow"
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

   When you are finished making changes to the policy document, choose **Allow**\. Your changes will be displayed in the IAM console\.

**Note**  
If role creation fails, it might be because you already have an IAM role named **AWS\-CodePipeline\-Service**\. If you have been using the **AWS\-CodePipeline\-Service** role before May 2016, the role might not have permissions to use AWS OpsWorks Stacks as a deployment provider\. In this case, you must update the policy statement as shown in this step\. If you see an error message, go back to the beginning of this step, and choose **Use existing role** instead of **Create role**\. If you use an existing role, the role should have a policy attached that includes the permissions shown in this step\. For more information about the service role and its policy statement, see [Edit a Policy for an IAM Service Role](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/access-permissions.html#how-to-custom-role)\.

1. If the role creation process is successful, the IAM page will close, and you will be returned to the **AWS Service Role** page\. Choose **Next step**\.

1. On the **Review your pipeline** page, verify the choices shown on the page, and then choose **Create pipeline**\.

1. When your pipeline is ready, it should start locating your source code and deploying your app to your stack automatically\. This process can take several minutes\.
