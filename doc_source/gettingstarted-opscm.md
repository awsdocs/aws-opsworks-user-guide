# Getting Started with AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate<a name="gettingstarted-opscm"></a>

AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate lets you run a [Chef Automate](https://www.chef.io/automate/) server in AWS\. You can provision a Chef server in about 15 minutes\.

Starting May 3, 2021, AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate stores some Chef Automate server attributes in AWS Secrets Manager\. For more information, see [Integration with AWS Secrets Manager](data-protection.md#data-protection-secrets-manager)\.

The following walkthrough helps you create your first Chef server in AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate\.

## Prerequisites<a name="gettingstarted-opscm-prereq"></a>

First, create the resources outside of AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate that you'll need to access and manage your Chef server\. If you already have an AWS account set up, skip to [Set Up a VPC](#set-up-vpc)\.

### Get an AWS account and your root user credentials<a name="getting-started-signup"></a>

To access AWS, you must sign up for an AWS account\.

**To sign up for an AWS account**

1. Open [https://portal\.aws\.amazon\.com/billing/signup](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup)\.

1. Follow the online instructions\.

   Part of the sign\-up procedure involves receiving a phone call and entering a verification code on the phone keypad\.

 AWS sends you a confirmation email after the sign\-up process is complete\. At any time, you can view your current account activity and manage your account by going to [https://aws\.amazon\.com/](https://aws.amazon.com/) and choosing **My Account**\.

Access keys consist of an access key ID and secret access key, which are used to sign programmatic requests that you make to AWS\. If you don't have access keys, you can create them from the AWS Management Console\. As a best practice, do not use the AWS account root user access keys for any task where it's not required\. Instead, [create a new administrator IAM user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/getting-started_create-admin-group.html) with access keys for yourself\.

The only time that you can view or download the secret access key is when you create the keys\. You cannot recover them later\. However, you can create new access keys at any time\. You must also have permissions to perform the required IAM actions\. For more information, see [Permissions required to access IAM resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_permissions-required.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

**To create access keys for an IAM user**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Users**\.

1. Choose the name of the user whose access keys you want to create, and then choose the **Security credentials** tab\.

1. In the **Access keys** section, choose **Create access key**\.

1. To view the new access key pair, choose **Show**\. You will not have access to the secret access key again after this dialog box closes\. Your credentials will look something like this:
   + Access key ID: AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
   + Secret access key: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY

1. To download the key pair, choose **Download \.csv file**\. Store the keys in a secure location\. You will not have access to the secret access key again after this dialog box closes\.

   Keep the keys confidential in order to protect your AWS account and never email them\. Do not share them outside your organization, even if an inquiry appears to come from AWS or Amazon\.com\. No one who legitimately represents Amazon will ever ask you for your secret key\.

1. After you download the `.csv` file, choose **Close**\. When you create an access key, the key pair is active by default, and you can use the pair right away\.

### Set Up a VPC<a name="set-up-vpc"></a>

Your AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate server must operate in an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud\. You can add it to an existing VPC, use the default VPC, or create a new VPC to contain the server\. For information about Amazon VPC and how to create a new VPC, see the [Amazon VPC Getting Started Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/GettingStartedGuide/)\.

If you create your own VPC, or use an existing one, the VPC should have the following settings or properties\.
+ The VPC should have at least one subnet\.

  If your AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate server will be publicly accessible, make the subnet public, and enable **Auto\-assign public IP**\.
+ **DNS resolution** should be enabled\.
+ On the subnet, enable **Auto\-assign public IP**\.

If you are unfamiliar with creating VPCs or running your instances in them, you can run the following AWS CLI command to create a VPC with a single public subnet, by using an AWS CloudFormation template that AWS OpsWorks provides for you\. If you prefer to use the AWS Management Console, you can also upload the [template](https://s3.amazonaws.com/opsworks-cm-us-east-1-prod-default-assets/misc/opsworks-cm-vpc.yaml) to the AWS CloudFormation console\.

```
aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name OpsWorksVPC --template-url https://s3.amazonaws.com/opsworks-cm-us-east-1-prod-default-assets/misc/opsworks-cm-vpc.yaml
```

### Prerequisites for Using a Custom Domain \(Optional\)<a name="gettingstarted-opscm-prereq-customdomain"></a>

You can set up your Chef Automate server on your own domain, specifying a public endpoint in a custom domain to use as the endpoint of your server\. When you use a custom domain, all of the following are required, as described in detail in this section\.

**Topics**
+ [Set Up a Custom Domain](#gettingstarted-opscm-prereq-domain)
+ [Get a Certificate](#gettingstarted-opscm-prereq-cert)
+ [Get a Private Key](#gettingstarted-opscm-prereq-privatekey)

#### Set Up a Custom Domain<a name="gettingstarted-opscm-prereq-domain"></a>

To run your Chef Automate server on your own custom domain, you will need a public endpoint of a server, such as `https://aws.my-company.com`\. If you specify a custom domain, you must also provide a certificate and a private key, as described in the preceding sections\.

To access the server after you create it, add a CNAME DNS record in your preferred DNS service\. This record must point the custom domain to the endpoint \(the value of the server's `Endpoint` attribute\) that is generated by the Chef Automate server creation process\. You cannot access the server by using the generated `Endpoint` value if the server is using a custom domain\.

#### Get a Certificate<a name="gettingstarted-opscm-prereq-cert"></a>

To set up your Chef Automate server on your own custom domain, you need A PEM\-formatted HTTPS certificate\. This can be be a single, self\-signed certificate, or a certificate chain\. As you complete the **Create Chef Automate server** workflow, if you specify this certificate, you must also provide a custom domain and a private key\.

The following are requirements for the certificate value:
+ You can provide either a self\-signed, custom certificate, or the full certificate chain\.
+ The certificate must be a valid X509 certificate, or a certificate chain in PEM format\.
+ The certificate must be valid at the time of upload\. A certificate can't be used before its validity period begins \(the certificate's `NotBefore` date\), or after it expires \(the certificate's `NotAfter` date\)\.
+ The certificateâ€™s common name or subject alternative names \(SANs\), if present, must match the custom domain value\.
+ The certificate must match the value of the **Custom private key** field\.

#### Get a Private Key<a name="gettingstarted-opscm-prereq-privatekey"></a>

To set up your Chef Automate server on your own custom domain, you need a private key in PEM format for connecting to the server by using HTTPS\. The private key must not be encrypted; it cannot be protected by a password or passphrase\. If you specify a custom private key, you must also provide a custom domain and a certificate\.

### Set Up an EC2 Key Pair \(Optional\)<a name="gettingstarted-opscm-prereq-keypair"></a>

An SSH connection is not necessary or recommended for typical management of the Chef server; you can use [https://docs.chef.io/knife.html](https://docs.chef.io/knife.html) commands to perform most management tasks on your Chef server\.

An EC2 key pair is required to connect to your server by using SSH in the event that you lose or want to change the sign\-in password for the Chef Automate dashboard\. You can use an existing key pair, or create a new key pair\. For more information about how to create a new EC2 key pair, see [Amazon EC2 Key Pairs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html)\.

If you don't need an EC2 key pair, you are ready to create a Chef server\.
