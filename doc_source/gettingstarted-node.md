# Creating Your First Node\.js Stack<a name="gettingstarted-node"></a>

This example describes how to create a Linux stack that supports a Node\.js application server and how to deploy a simple application\. The stack consists of the following components:
+ A [Node\.js App Server layer](workinglayers-node.md) with two instances
+ An [Elastic Load Balancing load balancer](layers-elb.md) to distribute traffic to the application server instances
+ An [Amazon Relational Database Service \(Amazon RDS\) service layer](#gettingstarted-node-next) that provides a backend database

## Prerequisites<a name="gettingstarted-node-start"></a>

This walkthrough assumes the following:
+ You have an AWS account and a basic understanding of how to use AWS OpsWorks Stacks\.

  If you are new to AWS OpsWorks Stacks or to AWS, learn the basics by completing the introductory tutorial in [Getting Started with Chef 11 Linux Stacks](gettingstarted.md)\.
+ You have a basic understanding of how to implement a Node\.js application\.

  If you are new to Node\.js, learn the basics by completing an introductory tutorial, such as [Node: Up and Running](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001808/index.html)\.
+ You have already created at least one stack in the AWS region that you plan to use for this example\.

  When you create the first stack in a region, AWS OpsWorks Stacks creates an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\) security group for each layer type\. You need these security groups to create the Amazon RDS database \(DB\) instance\. If you are new to AWS OpsWorks Stacks, we recommend that you use the same region for this example that you did when you followed the tutorial in [Getting Started with Chef 11 Linux Stacks](gettingstarted.md)\. If you want to use a new region, create a new stack in the region; the stack does not need to have layers or instances\. As soon as you create the stack, AWS OpsWorks Stacks automatically adds a set of security groups to the region\. 
+ You will create your stack in a [default VPC](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-supported-platforms.html)\.

  You can use EC2\-Classic for this walkthrough, but some of the details will differ slightly\. For example, with EC2\-Classic, you specify an instance's Availability Zone \(AZ\) instead of its subnet\.
+ Your AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) user has full\-access permissions for AWS OpsWorks Stacks\.

  For security reasons, we strongly recommend that you do not use your account's root credentials for this walkthrough\. Instead, create an IAM user with AWS OpsWorks Stacks full\-access permissions and use those credentials with AWS OpsWorks Stacks\. For more information, see [Creating an Administrative User](opsworks-security-users-manage-admin.md)\.

## Implementing the Application<a name="gettingstarted-node-app"></a>

This walkthrough uses a simple [Express](http://expressjs.com/) application that connects to the Amazon RDS DB instance and lists the instance's databases\. 

To implement the application, create a directory named `nodedb` in a convenient location on your workstation and add the following three files to it\. 

**Topics**
+ [The Package Descriptor](#w100ab1c14c63b7b9c11b8)
+ [The Layout File](#w100ab1c14c63b7b9c11c10)
+ [The Code File](#w100ab1c14c63b7b9c11c12)

### The Package Descriptor<a name="w100ab1c14c63b7b9c11b8"></a>

To create the application's package descriptor, add a file named `package.json` with the following contents to the `nodedb` directory\. `package.json` is required for Express applications and must be located in the application's root directory\. 

```
{
  "name": "Nodejs-DB",
  "description": "Node.js example application",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "*",
    "ejs": "*",
    "mysql": "*"
  }
}
```

This `package.json` example is fairly minimal\. It defines the required `name` and `version` attributes and lists the dependent packages:
+ `express` references the [Express](http://expressjs.com/) package\.
+ `ejs` references the [EJS](http://www.embeddedjs.com/) package, which the application uses to insert text into an HTML layout file\.
+ `mysql` references the [node\-mysql](https://github.com/felixge/node-mysql) package, which the application uses to connect to the RDS instance\.

For more information on package descriptor files, see [package\.json](https://npmjs.org/doc/files/package.json.html)\. 

### The Layout File<a name="w100ab1c14c63b7b9c11c10"></a>

To create the application's layout file, add a `views` directory to the `nodedb` directory, and then add a file to `views` named `index.html` with the following contents:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>AWS Opsworks Node.js Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>AWS OpsWorks Node.js Example</h1>
    <p>Amazon RDS Endpoint: <i><%= hostname %></i></p>
    <p>User: <i><%= username %></i></p>
    <p>Password: <i><%= password %></i></p>
    <p>Port: <i><%= port %></i></p>
    <p>Database: <i><%= database %></i></p>

    <p>Connection: <%= connectionerror %></p>
    <p>Databases: <%= databases %></p>
</body>
</html>
```

For this example, the layout file is a simple HTML document that displays some data from Amazon RDS\. Each `<%= ... =>` element represents the value of a variable that is defined in the application's code file, which we create next\.

### The Code File<a name="w100ab1c14c63b7b9c11c12"></a>

To create the application's code file, add a `server.js` file to the `nodedb` directory with the following contents\.

**Important**  
With AWS OpsWorks Stacks, a Node\.js application's main code file must be named `server.js` and be located in the application's root folder\. 

```
var express = require('express');
var mysql = require('mysql');
var dbconfig = require('opsworks'); //[1] Include database connection data
var app = express();
var outputString = "";

app.engine('html', require('ejs').renderFile);

//[2] Get database connection data
app.locals.hostname = dbconfig.db['host'];
app.locals.username = dbconfig.db['username'];
app.locals.password = dbconfig.db['password'];
app.locals.port = dbconfig.db['port'];
app.locals.database = dbconfig.db['database'];
app.locals.connectionerror = 'successful';
app.locals.databases = '';

//[3] Connect to the Amazon RDS instance
var connection = mysql.createConnection({
    host: dbconfig.db['host'],
    user: dbconfig.db['username'],
    password: dbconfig.db['password'],
    port: dbconfig.db['port'],
    database: dbconfig.db['database']
});

connection.connect(function(err)
{
    if (err) {
        app.locals.connectionerror = err.stack;
        return;
    }
});

// [4] Query the database
connection.query('SHOW DATABASES', function (err, results) {
    if (err) {
        app.locals.databases = err.stack;
    }
    
    if (results) {
        for (var i in results) {
            outputString = outputString + results[i].Database + ', ';
        }
        app.locals.databases = outputString.slice(0, outputString.length-2);
    }
});

connection.end();

app.get('/', function(req, res) {
    res.render('./index.html');
});

app.use(express.static('public'));

//[5] Listen for incoming requests
app.listen(process.env.PORT);
```

The example displays the database connection information and also queries the database server and displays the server's databases\. You can easily generalize it to interact with the database as needed\. The following notes refer to the numbered comments in the preceding code\.

**\[1\] Include database connection data**  
This `require` statement includes the database connection data\. As described later, when you attach a database instance to an app, AWS OpsWorks Stacks puts the connection data in a file named `opsworks.js`, which looks similar to the following:  

```
exports.db = {
  "host":"nodeexample.cdlqlk5uwd0k.us-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com",
  "database":"nodeexampledb",
  "port":3306,
  "username":"opsworksuser",
  "password":"your_pwd",
  "reconnect":true,
  "data_source_provider":"rds",
  "type":"mysql"}
```
`opsworks.js` is in the application's `shared/config` directory, `/srv/www/app_shortname/shared/config`\. However, AWS OpsWorks Stacks puts a symlink to `opsworks.js` in the application's root directory, so you can include the object by using just `require 'opsworks'`\. 

**\[2\] Get database connection data**  
This set of statements displays the connection data from `opsworks.js` by assigning the values from the `db` object to a set of `app.locals` properties, each of which maps to one of the <%= \.\.\. %> elements in the `index.html` file\. The rendered document replaces the <%= \.\.\. %> elements with the corresponding property values\.

**\[3\] Connect to the Amazon RDS instance**  
The example uses `node-mysql` to access the database\. To connect to the database, the example creates a `connection` object by passing the connection data to `createConnection`, and then calls `connection.connect` to establish the connection\.

**\[4\] Query the database**  
After establishing a connection, the example calls `connection.query` to query the database\. This example simply queries for the server's database names\. `query` returns an array of `results` objects, one for each database, with the database name assigned to the `Database` property\. The example concatenates the names and assigns them to `app.locals.databases,` which displays the list in the rendered HTML page\.  
For this example, there are five databases, the `nodeexampledb` database that you specified when you created the RDS instance and four others that are automatically created by Amazon RDS\.

**\[5\] Listen for incoming requests**  
The final statement listens for incoming requests on a specified port\. You don't have to specify an explicit port value\. When you add the app to your stack, you specify whether the application supports HTTP or HTTPS requests\. AWS OpsWorks Stacks then sets the `PORT` environment variable to 80 \(HTTP\) or 443 \(HTTPS\), and you can use that variable in your application\.  
It is possible to listen on other ports, but the Node\.js App Server layer's built\-in security group, **AWS\-OpsWorks\-nodejs\-App\-Server**, allows inbound user traffic only to ports 80, 443, and 22 \(SSH\)\. To allow inbound user traffic to other ports, [create a security group](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-network-security.html) with appropriate inbound rules and [assign it to the Node\.js App Server layer](workinglayers-basics-edit.md#workinglayers-basics-edit-security)\. Do not modify inbound rules by editing the built\-in security group\. Each time you create a stack, AWS OpsWorks Stacks overwrites the built\-in security groups with the standard settings, so any changes that you make will be lost\.

**Note**  
You can associate custom environment variables with your application when you [create](workingapps-creating.md#workingapps-creating-environment) or [update](workingapps-editing.md) the associated app\. You can also pass data to your application by using custom JSON and a custom recipe\. For more information, see [Passing Data to Applications](apps-data.md)\.

## Creating the Database Server and Load Balancer<a name="gettingstarted-node-create-db"></a>

This example uses Amazon RDS database server and Elastic Load Balancing load balancer instances\. You must create each instance separately and then incorporate it into your stack\. This section describes how to create new database and load balancer instances\. You instead can use existing instances, but we recommend that you read through the procedure to ensure that those instances are correctly configured\.

The following describes how to create a minimally configured RDS DB instance that is sufficient for this example\. For more information, see the [Amazon RDS User Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html)\.

**To create the RDS DB instance**

1. 

**Open the console\.**

   Open the [Amazon RDS console,](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/) and set the region to US West \(Oregon\)\. In the navigation pane, choose **RDS Dashboard**, and then choose **Launch DB Instance**\.

1. 

**Specify the database engine\.**

   Choose **MySQL Community Edition** as the database engine\.

1. 

**Decline multi\-AZ deployment\.**

   Choose **No, this instance\.\.\.**, and then choose **Next**\. You don't need multi\-AZ deployment for this example\.

1. 

**Configure the basic settings\.**

   On the **DB Instance Details** page, specify the following settings:
   + **DB Instance Class**: **db\.t2\.micro**
   + **Multi\-AZ Deployment**: **No**
   + **Allocated Storage**: **5** GB
   + **DB Instance Identifier**: **nodeexample**
   + **Master Username**: **opsworksuser**
   + **Master Password**: A password of your choice

   Record the instance identifier, user name, and password for later use, accept the default settings for the other options, and then choose **Next**\.

1. 

**Configure the advanced settings\.**

   On the **Configure Advanced Settings** page, specify the following settings:
   + **Database Name**: **nodeexampledb**
   + **DB Security Group\(s\)**: **AWS\-OpsWorks\-DB\-Master\-Server**
**Note**  
The **AWS\-OpsWorks\-DB\-Master\-Server** security group allows only your stack's instances to access the database\. If you want to access the database directly, attach an additional security group to the RDS DB instance with appropriate inbound rules\. For more information, see [Amazon RDS Security Groups](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Overview.RDSSecurityGroups.html)\. You also can control access by putting the instance in a VPC\. For more information, see [Running a Stack in a VPC](workingstacks-vpc.md)\.

   Record the database name for later use, accept the default values for the other settings, and then choose **Launch DB Instance**\.

The following procedure describes how to create an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer for this example\. For more information, see the [Elastic Load Balancing User Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/elastic-load-balancing.html)\.

**To create the load balancer**

1. 

**Open the Amazon EC2 console\.**

   Open the [Amazon EC2 console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/) and ensure that the region is set to US West \(Oregon\)\. In the navigation pane, choose **Load Balancers**, and then choose **Create Load Balancer**\.

1. 

**Define the load balancer\.**

   On the **Define Load Balancer** page, specify the following settings\.
   + **Name** – **Node\-LB**
   + **Create LB Inside** – **My Default VPC**

   Accept the default settings for the other options, and choose then **Next**\.

1. 

**Assign security groups\.**

   On the **Assign Security Groups** page, specify the following groups: 
   + **default VPC security group**
   + **AWS\-OpsWorks\-nodejs\-App\-Server**

   Choose **Next**\. On the **Configure Security Settings** page, choose **Next**\. You don't need a secure listener for this example\.

1. 

**Configure the health check\.**

   On the **Configure Health Check** page, set **Ping Path** to **/** and accept the default values for the other settings\. Choose **Next**\. On the **Add EC2 Instances** page, choose **Next**\. On the **Add Tags** page, choose **Review and Create**\. AWS OpsWorks Stacks handles the task of adding EC2 instances to the load balancer, and you won't need tags for this example\.

1. 

**Create the load balancer\.**

   On the **Review** page, choose **Create** to create the load balancer\.

## Creating the Stack<a name="gettingstarted-node-stack"></a>

You now have all the components needed to create the stack\.

**To create the stack**

1. 

**Sign in to the AWS OpsWorks Stacks console\.**

   Sign into the [AWS OpsWorks Stacks console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/), and choose **Add Stack**\.

1. 

**Create the stack\.**

   To create a new stack, choose **Chef 11 stack**, and then specify the following settings\.
   +  – **NodeStack**
   + **Region** – **US West \(Oregon\)**

     You can create a stack in any AWS region, but we recommend US West \(Oregon\) for tutorials\.

   Choose **Add Stack**\. For more information on stack configuration settings, see [Create a New Stack](workingstacks-creating.md)\.

1. 

**Add a Node\.js App Server layer with an attached load balancer\.**

   On the **NodeStack** page, choose **Add a layer**, and then specify the following settings:
   + **Layer type** – **Node\.js App Server**
   + **Elastic Load Balancer** – **Node\-LB**

   Accept the default values for the other settings, and then choose **Add Layer**\. 

1. 

**Add instances to the layer and start them\.**

   In the navigation pane, choose **Instances**, and then add two instances to the Rails App Server layer, as follows\.

   1. Under **Node\.js App Server**, choose **Add instance**\.

      Set **Size** to **t2\.micro**, accept the default values for the other settings, and then choose **Add Instance**\.

   1. Choose **\+Instance**, and then add a second **t2\.micro** instance to the layer in a different subnet\.

      This places the instance in a different Availability Zone \(AZ\)\.

   1. Choose **Add instance**\.

   1. To start both instances, choose **Start All Instances**\.

   You have assigned an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer to this layer\. When an instance enters or leaves the online state, AWS OpsWorks Stacks automatically registers or deregisters the instance with the load balancer\.
**Note**  
For a production stack, we recommend that you distribute your application server instances across multiple AZs\. If users can't connect to an AZ, the load balancer routes incoming traffic to instances in the remaining zones, and your site will continue to function\.

1. 

**Register the RDS DB instance with the stack\.**

   In the navigation pane, choose **Resources** and register the RDS DB instance with the stack, as follows\.

   1. Choose the **RDS** tab, and then choose **Show Unregistered RDS DB** instances\.

   1. Choose the **nodeexampledb** instance, and then specify the following settings:
      + **User** – The master user name that you specified when you created the instance; for this example\. **opsworksuser**\.
      + **Password** – The master password that you specified when you created the instance\.

   1. Choose **Register with Stack** to add the RDS DB instance to the stack as an [Amazon RDS service layer](workinglayers-db-rds.md)\.
**Warning**  
AWS OpsWorks Stacks does not validate the **User** or **Password** values, it simply passes them to the application\. If you enter them incorrectly, your application cannot connect to the database\.

   To add the RDS DB instance to the stack as an [Amazon RDS service layer](workinglayers-db-rds.md), choose **Register with Stack**\. 

## Deploying the Application<a name="gettingstarted-node-deploy"></a>

You must store the application in a remote repository\. When you deploy it, AWS OpsWorks Stacks deploys the code and related files from the repository to the application server instances\. For convenience, this example uses a public Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\) archive as the repository, but you also can use several other repository types, including Git and Subversion\. For more information, see [Application Source](workingapps-creating.md#workingapps-creating-source)\.

**To deploy the application**

1. 

**Package the application in an archive file\.**

   Create a `.zip` archive of the `nodedb` directory and subdirectories named nodedb\.zip\. You also can use other types of archive file, including gzip, bzip2, and tarball\. Note that AWS OpsWorks Stacks does not support uncompressed tarballs\. For more information, see [Application Source](workingapps-creating.md#workingapps-creating-source)\.

1. 

**Upload the archive file to Amazon S3\.**

   Upload `nodedb.zip` to an Amazon S3 bucket, make the file public, and copy the file's URL for later use\. For more information on how to create buckets and upload files, go to [Get Started With Amazon Simple Storage Service](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/GetStartedWithS3.html)\.
**Note**  
AWS OpsWorks Stacks can also deploy private files from an Amazon S3 bucket, but for simplicity, this example uses a public file\. For more information, see [Application Source](workingapps-creating.md#workingapps-creating-source)\.

1. 

**Create an AWS OpsWorks Stacks app\.**

   Return to the AWS OpsWorks Stacks console, in the navigation pane, choose **Apps**, and then choose **Add an app**\. Specify the following settings:
   + **Name** – `NodeDB`\.

     This string is the app's display name\. For most purposes, you need the app's short name, which AWS OpsWorks Stacks generates from the display name by transforming all characters to lower case and removing punctuation\. For this example, the short name is `nodedb`\. To verify an app's short name, after creating the app, choose the app on the **Apps** page to display its details page\.
   + **Type** – `Node.js`\.
   + **Data source type** – `RDS`\.
   + **Database instance** – Choose the Amazon RDS DB instance that you registered earlier\. 
   + **Database name** – Specify the database name that you created earlier, `nodeexampledb` for this example\.
   + **Repository type** – `Http Archive`\.

     You must use this repository type for public Amazon S3 files\. The `S3 Archive` type is used only for private archives\.
   + **Repository URL** – The archive file's Amazon S3 URL\. It should look something like `https://s3.amazonaws.com/node_example/nodedb.zip`\.

   Use the default values for the remaining settings, and then click **Add App** to create the app\.

1. 

**Deploy the app\.**

   Go to the **Apps** page, and in the NodeDB app's **Actions** column, choose **deploy**\. Then choose **Deploy** to deploy the app to the server instances\. AWS OpsWorks Stacks runs the Deploy recipes on each instance, which downloads the application from the repository and restarts the server\. When each instance has a green check mark and the **Status** is **successful**, deployment is complete and the application is ready to start handling requests\. 
**Note**  
If the deployment fails, choose **show** in the **Log** column to display the deployment's Chef log\. The error information is near the bottom\.

1. 

**Open the application\.**

   To open the application, choose **Layers**, choose the load balancer, and then choose the load balancer's DNS name, which sends an HTTP request to the load balancer\. You should see something like the following\.  
![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/images/node_walkthrough.png)

**Note**  
AWS OpsWorks Stacks automatically deploys apps to new instances during setup\. Manual deployment is required only for online instances\. For more information, see [Deploying Apps](workingapps-deploying.md)\. For a general discussion of deployment, including some more sophisticated deployment strategies, see [Managing and Deploying Apps and Cookbooks](best-deploy.md)\.

## What Next?<a name="gettingstarted-node-next"></a>

This walkthrough took you through the basics of setting up a simple Node\.js application server stack\. Here are some suggestions for what to do next\.

**Examine the Node\.js built\-in cookbooks**  
If you want to know how the instances are configured in detail, see the layer's built\-in cookbook, [opsworks\_nodejs](https://github.com/aws/opsworks-cookbooks/tree/release-chef-11.10/opsworks_nodejs), which contains the recipes and related files that AWS OpsWorks Stacks uses to install and configure the software, and the built\-in [deploy cookbook](https://github.com/aws/opsworks-cookbooks/tree/release-chef-11.10/deploy), which contains the recipes that AWS OpsWorks Stacks uses to deploy the apps\.

**Customize the server configuration**  
The example stack is fairly basic\. For production use, you will probably want to customize the stack\. For more information, see [Customizing AWS OpsWorks Stacks](customizing.md)\.

**Add SSL support**  
You can enable SSL support for your app and provide AWS OpsWorks Stacks with the appropriate certificates when you create the app\. AWS OpsWorks Stacks then installs the certificates in the appropriate directory\. For more information, see [Using SSL](workingsecurity-ssl.md)\.

**Add in\-memory data caching**  
Production\-level sites often improve performance by caching data in an in\-memory key\-value store, such as Redis or Memcache\. You can use either with an AWS OpsWorks Stacks stack\. For more information, see [ElastiCache Redis](other-services-redis.md) and [Memcached](workinglayers-mem.md)\.

**Use a more sophisticated deployment strategy**  
The example used a simple app deployment strategy, which deploys the update to every instance concurrently\. This approach is simple and fast, but there is no margin for error\. If the deployment fails or the update has any issues, every instance in your production stack could be affected, potentially disrupting or disabling your site until you can fix the problem\. For more information on deployment strategies, see [Managing and Deploying Apps and Cookbooks](best-deploy.md)\.

**Extend the Node\.js App Server layer**  
You can extend the layer in a variety of ways\. For example, you can implement recipes to run scripts on the instances or implement Chef deployment hooks to customize app deployment\. For more information, see [Extending a Layer](workingcookbook-extend.md)\.

**Define environment variables**  
You can pass data to your application by defining environment variables for the associated app\. When you deploy the app, AWS OpsWorks Stacks exports those variables so you can access them from your app\. For more information, see [Using Environment Variables](apps-environment-vars.md)\.
