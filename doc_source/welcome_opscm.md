# AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate<a name="welcome_opscm"></a>

AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate lets you run a [Chef Automate](https://www.chef.io/automate/) server in AWS\. You can provision a Chef server within minutes, and let AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate handle its operations, backups, restorations, and software upgrades\. AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate frees you to focus on core configuration management tasks, instead of managing a Chef server\.

A Chef Automate server manages the configuration of nodes in your environment by instructing [https://docs.chef.io/chef_client.html](https://docs.chef.io/chef_client.html) which Chef recipes to run on the nodes, stores information about nodes, and serves as a central repository for your Chef cookbooks\. AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate provides Chef servers that include premium features of Chef Automate: Chef Infra and Chef InSpec\.

An AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate server runs on an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud instance\. AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate servers are configured to run the newest version of Amazon Linux \(Amazon Linux 2\)\. For information about what has changed in this version of Chef Automate, see the [Chef Automate Release Notes](https://automate.chef.io/release-notes/?v=20190415203801)\. The following table describes the Chef components that are installed on an AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate server\.


| Component name | Description | Version installed on AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate server | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Chef Automate |  Chef Automate is an enterprise server software package that provides automated workflow for continuous deployment, and insights about managed nodes in a web\-based management console\. Chef Automate delivers infrastructure automation by including Chef Infra, security and compliance information and enforcement by including Chef InSpec, and automated deployment by including Chef Habitat\. For more information about Chef Automate, see [Chef Automate](https://www.chef.io/products/automate/) on the Chef website\.  | 2\.0 | 
| Chef Infra |  Formerly called Chef Server, Chef Infra Server uses the Chef Infra Client \(`chef-client`\) agent to continuously apply configurations to managed nodes to maintain a desired state\. For more information about Infra, see [Chef Infra](https://www.chef.io/products/chef-infra/) on the Chef website\.  | 12\.x | 
| Chef InSpec |  Chef InSpec describes security and compliance rules that can be shared between software engineers, operations, and security engineers\. Compliance, security, and other policy requirements form the framework for automated tests that the `chef-client` agent can run against managed nodes, ensuring consistent enforcement of standards\. For more information about InSpec, see [Chef InSpec](https://www.chef.io/products/chef-inspec/) on the Chef website\.  | 3\.9\.0 | 

The minimum supported version of `chef-client` on nodes associated with an AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate server is 13\.*x*\. We recommend running at least 14\.10\.9, or the [most current, stable `chef-client` version](https://downloads.chef.io/chef/stable)\.

When new minor versions of Chef software become available, system maintenance is designed to update the minor version of Chef Automate and Chef Server on the server automatically, as soon as it passes AWS testing\. AWS performs extensive testing to verify that Chef upgrades are production\-ready and do not disrupt existing customer environments, so there can be lags between Chef software releases and their availability for application to existing OpsWorks for Chef Automate servers\. System maintenance also upgrades your server to the newest version of Amazon Linux\.

You can connect any on\-premises computer or EC2 instance that is running a supported operating system and has network access to an AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate server\. For a list of supported operating systems for nodes that you want to manage, see the [Chef website](https://docs.chef.io/platforms.html)\. The [https://docs.chef.io/chef_client.html](https://docs.chef.io/chef_client.html) agent software is installed on nodes that you want to manage with a Chef server\.
